# DevOps Tools Infrastructure

This repository provides a reference implementation of a modern DevOps toolchain using the following technologies:

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud-native infrastructure
- **Argo CD** – Declarative GitOps deployment for Kubernetes
- **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration and workload management
- **Grafana** – Metrics visualization and monitoring dashboards
- **Prometheus** – Monitoring and alerting system for metrics scraping

> This setup is ideal for deploying and managing scalable microservices with GitOps principles, infrastructure automation, and full observability.
